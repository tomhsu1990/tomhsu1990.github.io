										<h2>AI Playground</h2>
										This series documents my hands-on explorations into open-source AI systems, particularly those that bridge perception, cognition, and control in the physical world. Projects span from text-to-3D generation and real-time simulation, to fine-tuning language models for cultural expression.	Each entry emphasizes practical deployment, model adaptation, and system integration—skills essential for building robust embodied AI systems. Rather than treating these projects as isolated demos, I approach them as part of a broader effort to understand how intelligence can emerge through grounded, real-world interactions.

										<h2>C++ Journey</h2>
										This series chronicles my deepening understanding of modern C++—from syntax-level precision to system-level design. Each post reflects not only language features, but also the real-world engineering challenges I've faced in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Topics such as smart pointers, polymorphism, and concurrency are discussed in the context of building safety-critical software where performance, determinism, and maintainability are paramount. These notes serve as both a personal knowledge base and a way to connect C++ idioms to high-stakes system behavior.
